# flamegraph.js

If you don't know what flame graphs are, check [Brendan Gregg's post](http://www.brendangregg.com/flamegraphs.html).

This library was originally forked from [spiermar/d3-flame-graph](https://github.com/spiermar/d3-flame-graph), but got completely rewritten to provide better performance and interactivity for large data sets.
